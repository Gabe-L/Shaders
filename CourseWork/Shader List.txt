Explosion shader
----------------
- Only affects explosions, and intensity of one light at a time
- Shaders:
 - Vertex Shader (Multi channel height map displacement)
 - Pixel Shader  (Samples colour ramp texture for displacement)

Tessellation/Geometry Shader
----------------------------
- Affects terrain and grass generated on terrain
- Shaders:
 - Vertex Shader (Passing info forward)
 - Hull Shader (Calculating tess factor)
 - Domain Shader (Displacing terrain based on height map, recalculating normals)
 - Geometry Shader (Generates blades of grass from tesselated points)
 - Pixel Shader (Calculates light + texture info based on if grass or terrain)

Shadow Map/Lights
-----------------
- Affects every object (except explosions)
- Depth Shader also required
- Shaders:
 - Vertex Shader (Calculating light info for vertices, passing forward)
 - Pixel Shader (Calculating light/shadow info for pixels based on depth maps)

Depth of Field
--------------
- Post process
- Hor/Vertical blur and DoF shader
